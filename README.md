# Running Snake-iOS
To run the iOS Snake application we developed for this final project, first download the linked Snake-iOS directory.
Next, unzip the directory and double-click on the **Snake.xcodeproj** file. This should open the project in Xcode.
Finally, **command-R** will run the application in a simulator.

## ai Flag
The project defaults to the use of the AI agent written for the presentation. To turn off the AI and play the game interactively, navigate to the **Globals.swift** file. On line 13, set **ai** to false.
